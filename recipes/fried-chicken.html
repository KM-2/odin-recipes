            In a deep-fat fryer, heat oil to 375°. Fry chicken, several pieces at a time, until 
            chicken is golden brown and juices run clear, 7-8 minutes on each side. Drain on paper 
            towels.

            Typically, chicken should be fried for about 7-8 minutes per side. But keep in mind that 
            pieces can vary in size and thickness. The chicken is fully cooked when the thickest part 
            of the meat registers at 165° and the skin is crispy and dark golden-brown in color.

            Neutral oils like canola, vegetable and peanut oil have higher smoke points, making them 
            ideal for frying chicken. Learn more about selecting the right oil for frying.

            Yes, we recommend soaking chicken in milk before frying! Brining the chicken in 
            buttermilk before frying will give you moist and juicy results. The acid in the 
            buttermilk helps break down the protein in the chicken, creating tender meat.
